## Summary

* There is a high level summary of the results and two additional visualizations are suggested for future analysis.
  * One: Female ridership. Try to determine the cause of the gap between the number of Male & Female riders. This analysis could result in a business opportunity if the gap could closed.
  * Two: Further analysis of bike repairs. Would repair costs go down if bike are rotated from busy areas to less busy areas. Would the added cost of rotating bike negate possible savings from rotating the bikes.
