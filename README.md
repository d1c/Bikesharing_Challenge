# Bike Sharing Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this bike sharing analysis is in support of a business proposal. The proposal is to build a bike sharing business is Des Moines, IA modeled after the Citibike business in New York City. If successful, this business will provide an additional means of transportation in Des Moines. 

## Results

### Top Starting Locations
To begin, this visualization shows where most riders in New York City begin their trips using the Citibike service. The most used locations are centered around the downtown business district in Manhattan.

### Top Ending Locations
Not unexpected, most riders end their trips in the same area clustered around the large business district.

### Number of Trips by Weekday
The trip data clearly shows patterns in the most used time of the day when the service is used the most. The weekday morning and evening commute time periods saw the most use. While the weekends show consistent use throughout each day.

### Number of Trips by Weekday by Gender
Shown above is the same trip data from the previous slide broken out by gender. As we will see, the trip data clearly shows a gap in usage between male and female customers. Further research and analysis is needed to determine the reasons for the difference.

### Break Out of Customers vs. Subscribers
The above visualization breaks out the trip data by customers and subscribers. Male subscribers clearly make the most trips of any other group followed by female subscribers.

### Trip Duration by Gender
Again, looking at the duration of trip data broken down by gender. As seen previoulsy, male riders make up the most of the duration by a large margin.

### Bike Repairs
Looking at bike repairs which have the potential to impact the business in multiple ways. Poorly maintained bikes will result in fewer people willing to use the service. The top left corner the bike was used 479 times. While the bottom right corner the bike was used 2 times. The more times and longer duration a bike is used the more maintenance will be required.

## Summary

This analysis focuses on the New York City based Citibike program. The analysis is successful at identifying where the Citibike program is successful and a couple areas for possible improvement. These successes and possible improvements will help create a business proposal for a similar service in Des Moines, IA. 

A possible weakness of the analysis is that an analysis of the Des Moines area and how a similar business might compare to the Citibike service New York City. On the surface, Des Moines and New York City are vastly different cities. These differences could either be beneficial or detrimental to our business proposal.

### Additional Visualizations

1. Search for additional datasets that can be used to analyze and compare Des Moines and New York City.
2. Female ridership. Try to determine the cause of the gap between the number of Male & Female riders. This analysis could result in a business opportunity if the gap could closed.
3. Further analysis of bike repairs. Would repair costs go down if bike are rotated from busy areas to less busy areas. Would the added cost of rotating bike negate possible savings from rotating the bikes.
